# Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017
The Kaggle data science bowl 2017 is a competition aimed at using machine learning to improve early lung cancer detection. High-Resolution lung CT scans are provided, which are in the DICOM format. These scans are from high-risk patients, and are labeled based on whether that patient goes on to develop lung cancer a year from when the scans are taken. Our plan is to use Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) in our model, which will be programmed in Python. 

As most of our group members are fairly new to Python and machine learning, we are starting with an easier problem of first analyzing the MNIST database of handwritten digits. This will allow us to apply machine learning techniques to an easier problem, while also getting more familiar with Python.


<u><b>Progress</b></u>

•	Download MNIST dataset

•	Design a neural network on the images using Keras


<u><b>Future Objectives</b></u>

•	Practice using other machine learning techniques on the MNIST data

•	Download other datasets from http://deeplearning.net/datasets/ to practice on

•	Pre-process the Kaggle Lung Cancer data

•	Apply a CNN on the data 


<u><b>Dependencies</b></u>

•	Tensorflow

•	Keras
